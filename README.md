#  🧩🐾 Memo Game: Animal and Color Matching 🐾🧩

The Memo Game is an interactive puzzle game in Python where players match animals with their corresponding color patterns. The objective is to identify and pair an animal with its specific color or markings. Players are presented with a set of cards, each showing an animal or a color. The game proceeds in turns, where the player flips two cards at a time, trying to find the correct match. The goal is to find all the correct pairs in the fewest moves possible.

At the end of the game, a ranking list is displayed, showing your score and comparing it with other players' results.
